To install the module execute the following steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

"make test" do some tests. If you get error messages then you shouldn't install the module.
Take a look into the README to the TECHNICAL NOTE section for a description and send me a
bug report please. Otherwise your last step is:

   make install

and have a lot of fun with Sys::Statistics::Linux.

Don't forget to take a look into the "examples" diretory. :-)
